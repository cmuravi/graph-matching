\section{Models}
We describe four different models that can generate recommendation
graphs. The first model we describe is called the {\em fixed degree
model}, which is analyzed in Section \ref{fixed-degree}. In this
model, every $u\in R$ is related to a fixed number of uniformly
randomly chosen adjecent vertices $v\in R$. This model is interesting
not for its expressive power but because of its simplicity.  It is
easy to analyze and also motivates the analysis of richer models.

In Section \ref{weighted}, we generalize the fixed degree model to a
model where the graph is fixed and the edges can weights. In Section
\ref{hierarchy}, we analyze the {\em hierarchical tree model} which
aims to model recommendation trees that arise from relationships in a
product hierarchy. Finally, in Section~\ref{cartesian} we study the 
{\em cartesian product model} which aims to model recommendation 
graphs which arise from combining the relevancy advice of several 
different algorithms.
