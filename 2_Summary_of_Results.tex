\section{Summary of Results}
Our main contributions are the following:
\begin{enumerate}

\item We describe several general models such as the Hierarchical Tree
  Model and the Cartesian Product Model which describe how graph
  recommendation subgraphs arise probabilistically.

\item For each of these models, we describe a simple randomized linear
  time algorithm that solves the graph recommendation problem to near
  optimality in expectation.

\item We also show that a simple linear time greedy algorithm can
  approximate the problem to a constant factor in the worst case.

\item We prove that optimal recommendation subgraphs that satisfy the
  most trivial upper bounds exist with high probability even in random
  bipartite graphs with logarithmic average degree.

\item We show that the models described in the problem can describe
  real-life recommendation subgraphs and that the random sampling
  algorithms we describe find near optimal solutions to the graph
  recommendation problem.
